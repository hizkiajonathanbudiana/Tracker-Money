- Edit `src/app/layout.tsx` → `metadata.title`

### Change Colors:

## 🚀 Deployment

When you deploy to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

2. **Deploy** using your hosting platform
3. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs only work on HTTPS (auto on most hosts)
4. **Test Installation**: Try installing from the live URL

## 📱 Testing Tips

### Test Offline Mode:
1. Install the app
2. Turn off WiFi/internet
3. Open the app - it should still work!
4. Watch the offline indicator appear

1. Open in browser (incognito mode)
2. Wait for install prompt at bottom
3. Try clicking "Install"

### Test Updates:
1. Make a change to your app
2. Build and deploy
3. Open the installed app
4. Should show "Update Available" notification

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App not working offline?**
